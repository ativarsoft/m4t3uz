I've prepared for it too much.
Enough of creating a programming language (Templatizer)
or an operating system (Leaf).
I need to use dangerous tools (the C language).
I know C is not safe but I can write safe code with it.
Maybe I can translate it to a safer language later if I'm so
inclined.
I need to create something useful for someone and not
just prepare for it.
I can create a purely safe operating system in D but
I can't interface my code with an existing operating
system's language.
DLang's betterC with C libraries are not much of a good
idea because I end up using C libraries and libc anyway.
