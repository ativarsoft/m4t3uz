                The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html">staticlib</a> linkage type in Rust
                produces static library binaries that include the runtime and all the dependencies.
                According to the manual, "the purpose of this output type is to create a static library containing
                all of the local crate's code along with all upstream dependencies".

            <h2>Operating system development in modern languages and static libraries</h2>
            <p>
              It is difficult, in my opinion, to write C programs that include multiple static libraries in them in modern programming languages.
              Modern programming languages usually include a runtime library. Rust, D and Ada all include a runtime.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Rust runtime is very minimal but it is required because it includes definitions for basic integer types, vectors and others. The <code>no_std</code> macro leaves only operating system independent code that do not depend on allocations.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is analogous to -betterC in D. betterC removes the runtime library entirely. There is no GC, TypeInfo, or allocations.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rust does not require runtime initialization when Rust libraries are linked statically.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ada requires a runtime initialization by calling adainit and adafinal.
              </li>
              <li>
                D also requires runtime initialization when not in <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/betterc.html">betterC</a> mode for initializing the GC and other globals as well as calling some operating system functions for setting state such as pthreads.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In previous versions, <code>cargo init</code> created libraries by default instead of binaries.
              Those modules contained Rust-only code which were linked to static or dynamic libraries written in C, including the C standard library or any operating system library.
              Similarly, Ada libraries contain only Ada code.
              In fact, <code>.a</code> libraries can be linked just like <code>.o</code> object files, which in turn map to a source file written in a specific language.
            </p>
            <h2>Virtual address spaces</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space">
                Virtual addressing
              </a>
              can be used in addition to safe programming languages.
              That allows the developer to include legacy code written in older programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only the root user can run programs which will run as a different user (except for setuid).
              Daemons can fork its process in order to have a process running under an unprivileged user in order to insulate each API request from each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore the only major concern is the part of the programs that parse the request input (such as JSON or XML) which contain the authentication data of the request and the socket connection itself.
              The part of the server that deals with such type of data should be handled by a carefully verified framework written in a secure language, and the parts which contain code written in an older programming language should be in worker processes which are forked or executed.
            </p>
            <h2>Development roadmap</h2>
            <p>
              The following is my future development:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Convert Quick to a series daemons</li>
              <li>Remove autotools from Quick</li>
              <li>Merge Quick with Templatizer</li>
            </ol>
