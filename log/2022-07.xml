Templatizer plugins should not depend on any libraries.
Not even a runtime library.
<br/>
The higher level language used on the plugin forbids
pointers.
<br/>
Structs, arrays and strings are incompatible
and can't be passed as a function parameter
so they must be filled element by element.
<br/>
Getters and setters should be used to fill and retrieve
elements from them one by one, character by character,
element by element, field by field, machine word by
machine word.
